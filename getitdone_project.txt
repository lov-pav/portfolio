LINKEDIN PROJECT SECTION - GetItDone

===========================================
PROJECT NAME:
GetItDone - Full-Stack Productivity Application

PROJECT TIMEFRAME:
[Insert your dates, e.g., "September 2024 - November 2024" or "September 2024 - Present"]

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Developed a modern web-based productivity platform that unifies task management and calendar scheduling into a single, elegant interface. Built with Django REST Framework and React/TypeScript, featuring AWS Cognito authentication, real-time updates, and a glassmorphic UI design. The application enables users to create tasks with natural language input, manage events, track time, and receive intelligent notifications across multiple channels.

KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
• Architected and implemented RESTful API using Django REST Framework with 10+ endpoints for task, event, and notification management
• Integrated AWS Cognito authentication with custom JWT validation middleware and automatic user synchronization
• Designed normalized PostgreSQL database schema with 10 entities, implementing complex relationships including one-to-many, many-to-many, and optional foreign keys
• Built responsive React frontend with TypeScript, custom hooks for state management, and reusable component architecture
• Developed real-time notification system supporting multiple delivery channels (email, push, in-app) with user-configurable preferences
• Implemented task-event linking feature enabling users to schedule dedicated time blocks for task completion
• Created Docker Compose development environment with PostgreSQL and Redis for scalable deployment
• Designed comprehensive user experience with multiple calendar views (day/week/month), priority-based task organization, and drag-and-drop interactions

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Backend: Django 5.2, Django REST Framework, Python 3.14, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS Cognito
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, AWS Amplify, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose, JWT Authentication
APIs: RESTful API design, WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates

SKILLS DEMONSTRATED:
Full-Stack Development • RESTful API Design • Database Design & Normalization • AWS Cloud Services • Authentication & Security • React & TypeScript • State Management • Responsive UI/UX Design • Docker Containerization • Git Version Control
